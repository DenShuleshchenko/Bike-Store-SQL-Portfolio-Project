# Bike-Store-SQL-Portfolio-Project

This is my SQL portfolio project. I used the data on Bike Store from https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/getting-started/sql-server-sample-database/. I used SQLite in space of Jupiter Notebook for this job. In the project I performed data analysis on the given data using simple SQL statements (SELECT, GROUP BY, WHERE etc.) as well as more advanced techniques such as joins, window functions and CTE. I have also made my code as clean as possible, so that anyone could read it very easily.

There are nine files with data in it: "brands"(product brands), "categories"(product categories), "customers"(first and last names, email, address), "order_items"(list price, discount and quantity of ordered products),
"orders"(order date, delivery date, order status), "products"(product name, model year and list price), "staff"(first and last names, email, phone), "stocks"(quantity of products), "stores"(name, email, phone, address). Also there is file with photo of Bike Store database diagram.
